```

Note 1: Order a 20 (or greater) breakaway header, break into the required lengths.

Note 2: additional jumper shunts are required for IDE Pin 20 power and IRQ selection. Interrupt features are not currently used so no IRQ shunt has been provided in parts kits.

Note 3: changed from 74LS688 - they will not work here, because of used pull down resistors. 74LS need pull up, replacing with 74HCT is simplest solution.

Parts Kits
----------

Parts kits are available from [The Glitch Works](http://www.glitchwrks.com/xt-ide). Some substitutions will be made for the above list. The kit is a complete parts kit and includes everything you need to populate an XT-IDE rev 4 board -- you supply the solder and tools. The parts kit with a rev 4 PC board can be purchased through our Tindie store:

Substitutions
-------------

All 7400 series logic ICs can be substituted for LS, ALS, ACT, or HCT equivalents.

RP1, RP2, R3, and R4 are pull-up/pull-down resistors, their values are noncritical. Anything from 2.2K - 47K should be fine.
R1, R2 tolerance is not critical, but using a substantially different value will alter LED brightness. Do not use less than 220R.
C1 - C11 are power supply bypass, 0.01 - 0.1 uF axial or radial ceramic capacitors are fine.
C11 is for power supply decoupling, any value from 47 uF up is fine, aluminum electrolytic or tantalum.

SW1, SW2 are just 8 position DIP switches, use whatever is cheap/convenient.
D1 is just an indicator, use whatever you'd like
