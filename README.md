# XT-IDE 8-Bit IDE Controller for Robotron EC1834

This is a modified version of the original Glitchworks XT-IDE rev 4 controller.

The ISA edge connector is replaced with DIN 41612 connector, used by the Robotron EC1834 PC.

Also the layout of the PCB was modified, to fit the mounting height.

Modification was done by Mario Goegel.

[Glitch Works](http://www.glitchwrks.com/) continuing extension of the XT-IDE rev 2 ISA controller. This board, when used with a custom BIOS like the XT-IDE Universal BIOS, allows the use of modern 16-bit IDE devices on the 8-bit ISA bus.

More info on the Glitch Works project to provide boards, kits, and fully assembled units [can be found here](http://www.glitchwrks.com/xt-ide). A writeup on the rev 4 design process [is available here](http://www.glitchwrks.com/2017/11/23/xt-ide-rev4). 

If you're looking for the rev 3 branch, [it can be found here](https://github.com/glitchwrks/xt_ide/tree/rev_3). The README and related documentation have been preserved along with the design files.

### Jumper Settings

[modem7](http://minuszerodegrees.net/) created a great set of jumper diagrams for the rev 4 boards, available [on his site](http://www.minuszerodegrees.net/xtide/rev_4/XT-IDE%20Rev%204%20-%20general.htm).

### Bill of Materials

You can find a BOM with Mouser part numbers [here](https://github.com/glitchwrks/xt_ide/blob/master/bill_of_materials.md). Do note that you can purchase complete parts kits from [The Glitch Works](http://www.glitchwrks.com/xt-ide) in addition to bare PC boards.


### Slot 8 Support

If you want to use this card with an IBM 5160 PC/XT in Slot 8, you need a small daughterboard to make this happen. The project files for the board are available [on GitHub](https://github.com/glitchwrks/xt_ide_slot_8_support). You can find a writeup on the design and assembly process [here](http://www.glitchwrks.com/2017/02/03/slot-8-support). If you'd like to order a board, parts kit, or assembled module, see the [Glitch Works XT-IDE page](http://www.glitchwrks.com/xt-ide) for ordering information.
